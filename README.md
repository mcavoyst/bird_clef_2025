# BirdCLEF+ 2025: Automated Soundscape Analysis for Conservation

## Overview

The BirdCLEF+ 2025 competition focuses on leveraging machine learning to analyze soundscapes from the El Silencio Natural Reserve in Colombia. This reserve, located in the biodiverse Magdalena Valley, is a critical hotspot for endangered species and ecological restoration efforts. By automating the detection and classification of species in soundscape data, this project aims to support conservation efforts and provide insights into the ecological processes of restoration projects.

## Context

Humid tropical rainforests, such as those in the Magdalena Valley, are vital for climate regulation and biodiversity. However, these ecosystems face severe threats, including deforestation for cattle ranching and illegal logging. Fundación Biodiversa Colombia (FBC) works to conserve and restore these forests, with El Silencio Natural Reserve serving as a model for regional conservation and sustainability.

El Silencio protects 5,407 acres of tropical lowland forests and wetlands, hosting a diverse array of wildlife, including:
- 295 bird species
- 34 amphibian species
- 69 mammal species
- 50 reptile species
- Nearly 500 plant species

A significant portion of the reserve is undergoing ecological restoration, transitioning from pastures to thriving forests. This competition aims to aid these efforts by automating the analysis of soundscapes to monitor biodiversity and restoration progress.

## Goals

The primary objectives of this competition are:
1. **Species Identification**: Detect and classify species from different taxonomic groups in soundscape data from the Middle Magdalena Valley and El Silencio Natural Reserve.
2. **Low-Data Training**: Develop machine learning models capable of performing well with limited training samples, particularly for rare and endangered species.
3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Enhance models using unlabeled data to improve detection and classification accuracy.

## Impact

By advancing automated soundscape analysis, this project will:
- Enable researchers and conservation practitioners to monitor restoration activities more effectively.
- Provide insights into biodiversity trends and threats.
- Support adaptive conservation strategies to protect endangered species and ecosystems.
